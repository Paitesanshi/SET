Given the fair trades this turn, there is no immediate need to adjust trust levels with Bob or Carol. However, maintaining vigilance for any potential future unfair dealings is crucial.

Focus on acquiring more of Resource B and C through strategic exchanges to create high-value combinations. Monitor Carol's future proposals closely to understand her trading patterns better.

The trading environment appears stable, with resource transactions being straightforward and fair.",
